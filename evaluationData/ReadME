Supplementary material contains two directories corresponding to two user studies conducted for evaluation of proposed approach. Content in the directories can be read as-
-----------------------------------------------
directory: "user_study_data_experiment1" 

	- open .html file in the browser.
	- html page displays the colorization results and statistics of user study in experiment1.
	- Artist: Patterns colored by top artist on colorLovers.
	- Pattern Color-by-Number: automatic coloring suggestions by Lin et.al. algorithm.
	- Proposed Algorithm: automatic color suggestions by proposed method.
	- Reference Images: Shows retrieved reference images used by proposed algorithm.
	- 'T' (top 3), and '%'(percentage of time it was chosen as 'top 3').
	- 'B' (bottom 3), and '%' (percentage of time it was chosen as 'bottom 3').
-----------------------------------------------
directory: "user_study_data_experiment2" 

	- open .html file in the browser.
	- html page displays the colorization results and statistics of user study in experiment2.
	- PERCEPT: colorization generated using Kim et. al. color assignement method.
	- Proposed Algorithm: colorization generated by proposed color trasfer method.
	- Source: reference images whoes colors are used by both the methods. 
	- Votes: number of participants liked an image.

GUI_Experiment1.png: 

Screen-shot of interface used for experiment-1. All the 12 colorizations are randomised and displayed on screen, and participant were asked to choose 'top 3' and 'bottom 3' images.
-----------------------------------------------
GUI_Experiment2.png: 
Screen-shot of interface used for experiment-2. Two colorization of a template: one using proposed approach and one using PERCEPT, are randomised(left-righ) and displayed on the screen. Both the methods are compared for same color palette-template pair.
